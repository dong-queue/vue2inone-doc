    "intro": "<p>The <code>v-form</code> component has <strong>three</strong> functions that can be accessed by setting a <span style=`text-decoration: underline;`>ref</span> on the component. A ref allows us to access internal methods on a component, for example, <code>&lt;v-form ref=`form`&gt;</code>. <strong>this.$refs.form.validate()</strong> will validate all inputs and return if they are all valid or not. <strong>this.$refs.form.reset()</strong> will clear all inputs and reset their validation errors. <strong>this.$refs.form.resetValidation()</strong> will only reset input validation and not alter their state.</p>"
